# DC_Motor_Direction_Using_potentiometer  
-This project utilizes Atmega32 microcontroller,Potentiometer,LCD (16x2)character and DC_Motor

# Driver Implemented:  
1-DIO driver
2-LCD driver  
3-ADC driver  

# How it works ?  
-when you increse resistance Hamksha will move to the right side of lcd and motor will rotate CW  
-when you decrese resistance Hamksha will move to the left side of lcd and motor will rotate CCW  
-motor will stop in the location between (6-9) .
